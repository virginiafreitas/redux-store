  ### Description:
  The project is an assignment of a coding bootcamp program, with the purpose for students learn how to use Redux. The application is an e-commerce platform where users can buy products by signing up or signing in to their existing accounts and sign out.

  ### Installation:
  - Clone the initial code git repository.
  - Navigate on the terminal to the directory redux-store where the code was cloned to.
  - Type "npm i" and "npm start".
  - Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
  - Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
  - Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
  - Deploy the application to Heroku.

  ### Usage:
  [Click here](https://) to access the deployed application. GIVEN a book search engine:

  AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem. GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state:
    - WHEN I review the appâ€™s store THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
    - WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
    - WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
    - WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
    - WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API  ![screenshot](./images/homepage.gif)
  

  ### Contributing
  I have received advice from the UC Berkeley Extension tutor Matthew Calimbas on debugging and testing my code. I also reached out to the [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) webpage and [NPM Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/) for documentation.
